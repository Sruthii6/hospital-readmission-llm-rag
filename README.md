# 🏥 Predicting Hospital Readmission Risk with LLM + RAG

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-coming--soon-orange)

**Coming Soon!**  
This project applies Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to predict patient readmission risk.

## Highlights 
- RAG pipeline for real-time context retrieval from clinical notes
- Use of ClinicalBERT and Mistral-7B
- FAISS for dense retrieval
- Evaluation with standard medical NLP benchmarks

📅 Stay tuned! This repository will be updated with data pipelines, code, and results in the coming weeks.
